# Stock Price Predictor

This project builds a machine learning model to **predict stock price movements (up or down)** using historical market data.
The goal is not to perfectly predict the future (which is impossible in finance) but to create a **data-driven model** that performs better than random guessing.

---

## Features

* Uses **machine learning algorithms** like:

  * Logistic Regression
  * Random Forest
  * Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)
* Predicts **stock trend direction** (up or down).
* Achieves around **70% accuracy** on test data.
* Includes **data preprocessing, feature engineering, and backtesting**.

---

## Project Structure

* `StockPredictor.ipynb` â†’ Main Jupyter Notebook with full code.
* `data/` â†’ Folder for input stock market data (CSV files).
* `results/` â†’ Saved predictions and accuracy metrics.

---

## Requirements

Install dependencies with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Main libraries:

* pandas
* numpy
* scikit-learn
* matplotlib
* xgboost

##  How to Run

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/StockPredictor.git
   cd StockPredictor
   ```
2. Open the notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook StockPredictor.ipynb
   ```
3. Run all cells to:

   * Load stock data
   * Train the models
   * Evaluate accuracy
   * See prediction results

---

## ðŸ“Š Results

* Achieves \~70% accuracy on test data.
* Generates probability scores for stock movements.
* Visualizes predicted vs actual stock trends.

## Disclaimer

This project is for **educational purposes only**.
It is **not financial advice**. Stock prices are highly volatile and cannot be predicted with certainty.
